<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
You need python 3 to run this. Download it and at https://www.python.org/downloads/ then install

Download all the files here. You need to then open the terminal if you're using mac or command prompt if using Windows.

go to the directory where you downloaded the files using the command cd [filepath]. On my computer filepath is usually C:\Users\Momo\Downloads
for mac I think it should be /Users/your-username/Downloads

then type the command python3 setup.py install
</p>



<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
open commmand prompt or terminal and go to the directory where you downloaded the files
do the command cd scripts
then python3 bot.py


to add more "targets" theres a config.json file in the scripts folder. Add to that, follow the same format. Commas matter too. Use curly braces {} to add a new target under "targets"{}
